# Alias
My first pet-project.

This is my first own project. This is a game Alias.

The first view controler - greeding view controller. I use animation for title "Alias" and add one button "start game".

The second view controller - is category view contriller. You should choose one out of foure category: Animals, Clothes, Countries, Professions. (four buttons).

The third view controller - is game view controller. You should describe the word, which on the screen, and your team should guess the word on particular time.
Our team get a one score for right answer, and lose a one score for wrong answer. (button "right", button "skip", button "show result", progress bar with timer).

The fourth view controller - is score view controller. You can see your score and have some fan with joke (parse data from internet).
